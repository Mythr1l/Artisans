                            Do you need guidance in helping you with your house renovation? Artisan Builders specialize in all Residential Builds and Renovations. We understand that building or renovating your house can be a stressful process. We strive to make the whole renovation process enjoyable and stress-free as much as possible for all of our valued clients.
                            <br><br>
                            Here are some few tips and process when renovating that we find very helpful:
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Preparation</b>
                            <br><br>
                            The first step we do is to talk to you and try to fully understand what you want to accomplish in your home renovation and what are some reasons why you are renovating. By understanding and listening carefully to your specifications, we can be sure that we fully grasp what you are looking for in your renovation, what is important to you to be achieved and why these things are important.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Idea and Viability</b>
                            <br><br>
                            The following step is to convert your specifications into a design concept (or you may have opted to get the design beforehand from a qualified Architect or designer) and check whether what you would like to build or renovate is feasible. We will help you examine your project and identify any risks, challenges and search for options that will at the end make your project viable to complete.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Working Designs and Costing</b>
                            <br><br>
                            Once we have the drawings or design, we can then make a detailed project costing and also create a contract based on the specifications that you require for your project.
                            <br><br>
                            During the renovation process, we may uncover structural issues during the course of the work which you will have to be aware of. Situations like this will be specified and costed for your renovation.At Artisan Builders, we strive to make our project costing very competitive based on the amount of work specified and the expected quality of finished project.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Renovation</b>
                            <br><br>
                            As part of the renovation process, we may hire expert trades and sub-contractors in specific fields who will handle certain areas of the renovation process and ensure it is done properly, on time and at the right cost. We also ensure quality control of each stage of the process, to get rid of any issues or disputes at the end of the renovation process.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Your Completed Home Renovation</b>
                            <br><br>
                            The final stage of the renovation is to ensure all Council Documentation (which will include the code compliance certificates) if applicable are all done. We will then happily turn over your newly- renovated home to you knowing that we have accomplished your requirements to the smallest detail.
                            If you would like to do some home renovation as your next project, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us!
